# Task-Breakdown-Assistant
Task Breakdown Assistant is a special helper that breaks big tasks into smaller, easier tasks. It's like when you have a big pile of toys to clean up, and instead of trying to do it all at once, you pick up one toy at a time! The assistant uses a smart computer brain (called llama3.2) to help figure out all the little steps.
